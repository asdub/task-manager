### Brief

My intention was to create a secure, effective and efficient app that allowed me to demonstrate both my React, Django and Django REST Framework skillset. With this in mind I decided to build a task management app using these frameworks.

Having previously designed my own layouts and styles, and wanting to create a familiar experience for the User and use a framework. The[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)
component libary has been used with some custom styling.
